```{r}
db <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
db
```



> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
sum_comma <- function(x) {
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))
}

```

For Xray:
```{r}
round(sum_comma(db$X.ray) / sum_comma(db$Total) * 100, 2)
```

For EM:
```{r}
round(sum_comma(db$EM) / sum_comma(db$Total) * 100, 2)
```



> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round(sum_comma(db[1,8]) / sum_comma(db$Total) * 100, 2)
```



> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

```{r}

```
SKIPPED!



> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

The molecules are too small to see in the structure.



> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

It is number 308


> Q6:
![HIV-PR structure from MERK with a bounf drug](1HSG.png)



> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

There are 198 AA residues.



> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

MK1



> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?  

2



# Working with structures in R

We can use 

```{r}
library(bio3d)
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Read an ADK structure.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```


perform a prediction of flexibility

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```


Write out a "movie" (aka trajectory) of the motion for viewing in MOlstar

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
